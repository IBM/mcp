# IBM MCP Servers

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by IBM, to connect your IBM products to any AI Agent or AI application.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol designed to enable AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This collection of IBM MCP services focuses on both production-ready and experimental MCP servers that enhance AI capabilities by providing file access, database connections, API integrations, and additional contextual services.

## Available servers

### IBM API Connect for GraphQL

Any GraphQL endpoint server by API Connect for GraphQL SaaS also supports an MCP stateless HTTP server supporting `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

Tools can be defined within a GraphQL schema using [`@tool` directive](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect-graphql/saas?topic=directives-directive-tool).

A *GraphQL tool* is a subset of the schema that the LLM generates a valid GraphQL request against.

 - [`tools/list`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect-graphql/saas?topic=directives-directive-tool#accessing-tool-descriptions__title__1)
