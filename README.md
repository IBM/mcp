# IBM MCP Servers

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by IBM, to connect your IBM products to any AI Agent or AI application.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol designed to enable AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This collection of IBM MCP services focuses on both production-ready and experimental MCP servers that enhance AI capabilities by providing file access, database connections, API integrations, and additional contextual services.

### ContextForge MCP Gateway

- [ContextForge MCP Gateway](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge) is an MCP server, feature-rich gateway, and proxy that federates MCP and REST services-delivering unified discovery, authentication, rate-limiting, observability, multi-transport protocols, and an optional HTMX-powered admin UI through a single endpoint; It lets you create **Virtual MCP Servers** combining tools and resources across multiple servers, and it can be installed via PyPI (`pip install mcp-contextforge-gateway`) or deployed as a container - and scales horizontally across Kubernetes clusters with Redis-backed federation and caching.
