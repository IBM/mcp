# IBM MCP Servers

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by IBM, to connect your IBM products to any AI Agent or AI application.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol designed to enable AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This collection of IBM MCP services focuses on both production-ready and experimental MCP servers that enhance AI capabilities by providing file access, database connections, API integrations, and additional contextual services.

## Available servers

### Terraform MCP Server

The [Terraform MCP Server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server) provides seamless integration with Terraform ecosystem, enabling advanced automation and interaction capabilities for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) development. The use cases include

- Automating Terraform provider, policy and module discovery
- Extracting detailed information about provider resources, data sources, user guides and functions

### IBM API Connect for GraphQL

Any GraphQL endpoint server by API Connect for GraphQL SaaS also supports an MCP stateless HTTP server supporting `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

Tools can be defined within a GraphQL schema using [`@tool` directive](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect-graphql/saas?topic=directives-directive-tool).

A *GraphQL tool* is a subset of the schema that the LLM generates a valid GraphQL request against.

 - [`tools/list`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect-graphql/saas?topic=directives-directive-tool#accessing-tool-descriptions__title__1)
 - [`tools/call`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect-graphql/saas?topic=directives-directive-tool#making-tool-calls__title__1)
