# IBM MCP Servers

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers by IBM, to connect your IBM products to any AI Agent or AI application.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol designed to enable AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This collection of IBM MCP services focuses on both production-ready and experimental MCP servers that enhance AI capabilities by providing file access, database connections, API integrations, and additional contextual services.
